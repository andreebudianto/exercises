/* Phase 0 Week 2 Exercise 1 */
/* Pseudocode Challenge */

==============================
Question 1 - Newton Second Law
==============================
Algorithm =
-----------
1. Create a new variable named 'mass' and set the value to 600.
2. Create a new variable named 'acceleration' and set the value to 2.
3. Create a new variable named 'force' to store the calculation result and set the value to 0.
4. Read and save the mass value of the car into variable 'mass'.
5. Read and save the acceleration value that given to the car into variable 'acceleration'.
6. Calculate the value of 'mass' variable and the value of 'acceleration' variable using the math formula (Î£F = m x a).
7. Store the calculation result into 'force' variable.
8. Display the value of 'force' variable.

Pseudocode =
------------
CREATE and STORE "mass" with value 600
CREATE and STORE "acceleration" with value 2
CREATE and STORE "force" with value 0
READ and SAVE "mass"
READ and SAVE "acceleration"
CALCULATE "mass" times "height"
SET "force" value with the calculation result
DISPLAY "force" value


==============================
Question 2 - Leap Year
==============================
Algorithm =
-----------
1. Create a new variable named 'year' and set the value to any value.
2. Read and save the input value into variable 'year'.
3. Check the 'year' value with conditional event "IF" combined with comparison operator "AND" and "OR".
4. First condition = if the result of 'year' modulus by 4 is 0 and the result of 'year' modulus by 100 is greater than 0.
5. Second condition = if the result of 'year' modulus by 4 is 0 and the result of 'year' modulus by 100 is 0 and the result of 'year' modulus by 400 is 0.
6. Make a conditional sentence with operator "IF-THEN-ELSE" including first condition and second condition combined with comparison operator "OR".
7. If one of the two conditions is fulfilled, display the result that current year is a leap year.
8. If none of the two conditions is fulfilled, display the result that current year is not a leap year.
   Example =    IF first condition OR second condition THEN
                    ......
                ELSE
                    ......
                END IF
Pseudocode =
------------
CREATE and STORE "year" with any value
READ and SAVE "year"
IF
    (year MODULUS BY 4 EQUALS TO 0) AND (year MODULUS BY 100 GREATER THAN 0) ) 
    OR 
    (year MODULUS BY 4 EQUALS TO 0) AND (year MODULUS BY 100 EQUALS TO 0) AND (year MODULUS BY 400 EQUALS TO 0) 
THEN
    DISPLAY "Current year is a leap year."
ELSE
    DISPLAY "Current year is not a leap year."
END IF

Question 3 - Laundry Day
==============================
Algorithm =
-----------
1. Create a new variable named 'clothes' and set the value to 20.
2. Create a new variable named 'counter' and set the value to 0.
3. Create a new variable named 'amount' and set the value to 0.
4. Read and save the amount of clothes into variable 'clothes'.
5. Do a looping condition by using operator "WHILE" with condition that 'counter' value is smaller than 'clothes' value.
6. When the condition is fulfilled :
   Increase the value of 'amount' variable by 1,
   Increase the value of 'counter' by 1,
   Make a conditional sentence with operator "IF" with condition = if the 'amount' value equals with 'clothes' value then turn on the wash machine. 

Pseudocode =
------------
CREATE and STORE "clothes" with value 20
CREATE and STORE "counter" with value 0
CREATE and STORE "amount" with value 0
READ and SAVE "clothes"
WHILE counter SMALLER THAN clothes
    INCREMENT counter
    INCREMENT amount
    IF amount EQUALS TO clothes THEN
        DO turn on the wash machine
    END IF
END WHILE

==============================
Question 4 - Nail Checker
==============================
Algorithm =
-----------
1. Create a new variable named 'students' and set the value to 40.
2. Create a new variable named 'counter' and set the value to 0.
3. Create a new variable named 'nail' and set the value to false.
4. Read and save the amount of students into variable 'students'.
5. Do a looping condition by using operator "WHILE" with condition that 'counter' value is smaller than 'students' value.
6. When the condition is fulfilled :
   Make a conditional sentence with operator "IF" to check the student's nail with condition = 
        If the student's nail is long then set the 'nail' value to true.
        If the student's nail is not long then set the 'nail' value to false.
   Make a conditional sentence with operator "IF" with condition = 
        If the 'nail' value is true then do a punishment.
        If the 'nail' value is false then do a compliment.
   Increase the value of 'counter' by 1

Pseudocode =
------------
CREATE and STORE "students" with value 40
CREATE and STORE "counter" with value 0
CREATE and STORE "nail" with value false
READ and SAVE "students"
WHILE counter SMALLER THAN students
    IF nail is long THEN
        SET nail to true
    ELSE
        SET nail to false
    END IF
    IF nail is true THEN
        DO give a punishment to the student 
    ELSE
        DO give a compliment to the student
    END IF
    INCREMENT counter
END WHILE
